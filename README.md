AI Disaster Classification
Overview
The AI Disaster Classification project leverages machine learning techniques to classify disaster-related images into various categories. This project aims to provide an automated system for efficiently categorizing images of natural disasters, which can aid in disaster response and management.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies disaster images into predefined categories (e.g., earthquake, flood, fire).
Pre-trained Model: Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate classification.
User Interface: Simple web interface for uploading and classifying images (if applicable).
Performance Metrics: Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
