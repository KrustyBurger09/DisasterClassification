# AI Disaster Classification

## Overview

The AI Disaster Classification project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify disaster-related images into various categories. This system aims to provide an automated method for efficiently categorizing images of natural disasters, assisting in disaster response and management.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classifies disaster images into predefined categories such as earthquake, flood, and fire.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Leverages a pre-trained deep learning model for accurate and efficient classification.
- **User Interface**: Provides a simple web interface (if applicable) for uploading and classifying images.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
